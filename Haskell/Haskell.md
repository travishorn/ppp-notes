# Haskell
Haskell is a [declarative](./Imperative vs Declarative.md), [statically typed](./Dynamic vs Static Typing.md), [purely functional](./Impure vs Pure Functions.md) [[Programming]] language with type inference and [lazy evaluation](./Strict vs Lazy Evaluation.md).

Smart contracts for the proof-of-stake blockchain platform [Cardano](../Cardano.md) are written in Haskell.

Haskell uses very math-like concepts. It is basically an implementation of the lambda calculus for computers.
