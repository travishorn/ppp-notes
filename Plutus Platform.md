# Plutus Platform
The Plutus platform provides a native smart contract language for the [Cardano](./Cardano.md) blockchain. It is built upon the [Haskell](./Haskell/Haskell.md) programming] language.

As of January 2022, the platform is still very new. Input Output HK (IOHK), also known as Input Output Global (IOG) provide a "pioneer program" for the first group of developers trying to learn how to use it. It's called the [Plutus Pioneer Program](./Plutus Pioneer Program.md).
