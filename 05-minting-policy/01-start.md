This lecture is about using Plutus with native tokens and "minting." 

Remember that in the UTxO model, transactions have:

- An address
- A value
- A datum

So far, the value we work with in these lectures is usually ADA (or it's
fractional unit "Lovelace").

When working with native tokens instead of ADA, you define a way to "mint" the
tokens and a way to "burn" the tokens.
