Two modules are provided: `Homework01.hs` and `Homework02.hs`.

### Homework 1

The redeemer has been changed to a pair of `Bool`s. Validation should only
succeed if they match.

### Homework 2

It's the same as Homework 1 except the redeemer is a custom type called
`MyRedeemer` that has two fields called `flag1` and `flag2` that are just
`Bool`s.
