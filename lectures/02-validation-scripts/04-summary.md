We looked at typed and untyped validators.

Starting with one that always succeeds. Moving to one that always fails. Then
one that actually looks at the redeemer and checks for a hard-coded value.

Finally we looked at custom datatypes for validators.

The typed version will be used in practice.

We have not yet looked at examples where datum or context is used. That will be
in lecture 3.
