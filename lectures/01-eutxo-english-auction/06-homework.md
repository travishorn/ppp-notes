The homework for this lecture was to

2. Set up binary caches
3. Clone and check out the correct version of the `plutus-apps` repository
4. Start a Nix shell
5. Compile this weeks code
6. Run a local instance of the Plutus Playground
7. Paste in the `EnglishAuction.hs` code
8. Play with the contract in various scenarios

I've detailed the steps I took to do these things:

- [Play with the English Auction contract on Plutus
  Playground](./05-auction-contract-playground.md)
