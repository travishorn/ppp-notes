The homework for this lecture was to

1. Install Nix
2. Set up binary caches
3. Clone and check out the correct version of the `plutus-apps` repository
4. Start a Nix shell
5. Compile this weeks code
6. Run a local instance of the Plutus Playground
7. Paste in the `EnglishAuction.hs` code
8. Play with the contract in various scenarios

I've detailed the steps I took to do these things:

- [Run Plutus Playground
  locally](../../appendix/run-plutus-playground-locally.md)
- [Build the auction code](./03-building-example-code.md)
- [Play with the English Auction contract on Plutus
  Playground](./05-auction-contract-playground.md)
