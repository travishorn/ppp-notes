Imagine you want to gift some ADA to a child but don't want them to be able to
access it until a certain age. It's easy to lock ADA into a contract and only be
able to pull it out after a certain time.

Most of my notes for this part are done as comments directly in source code.

`Vesting.hs` is a modified version of the `IsData.hs` script from last week.
That's the one we learned custom types on.

These notes are partial. Up to timestamp 10:45 on the lecture video.
