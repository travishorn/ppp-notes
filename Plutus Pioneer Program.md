# Plutus Pioneer Program
This program's goal is to educate developers on the [[Plutus Platform]]. Which is a smart-contract language for [[Cardano]] that is based on the [[Haskell]] programming language.

To understand and become proficient in Plutus, one has to understand the following concepts:

- The [[Haskell]] [[Programming|programming]] language
- The **Extended UTXO model (EUTXO)**
- **Plutus Core** - the "on-chain" part of Plutus
- The **Plutus Application Framework (PAF)** - the "off-chain" part of Plutus that enables interaction with smart contracts.
- The **Plutus Application Binary (PAB)**

This is an education program for [[Programming|programmers]]. I am a part of the 3rd cohort: 10 weeks from January to March 2022.

During the program, it may be helpful to [[Run Plutus Playground Locally|run the Plutus Playground locally]].
