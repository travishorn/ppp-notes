# Plutus Pioneer Program

As I go through the program as a member of the 3rd cohort, I'm documenting my
notes in this repository.

This program's goal is to educate developers on the [Plutus
Platform](./plutus-platform.md). Which is a smart-contract language for
[Cardano](./cardano.md) that is based on the [Haskell](./haskell/haskell.md)
programming language.

To understand and become proficient in Plutus, one has to understand the
following concepts:

- The **Haskell** programming language
- The **Extended UTXO model (EUTXO)**
- **Plutus Core** - the "on-chain" part of Plutus
- The **Plutus Application Framework (PAF)** - the "off-chain" part of Plutus
  that enables interaction with smart contracts.
- The **Plutus Application Binary (PAB)**

This is an education program for programmers. I am a part of the 3rd cohort: 10
weeks starting in January and ending March 2022.
