# Plutus Pioneer Program

As I go through the program as a member of the 3rd cohort, I'm documenting my
notes here.

This program's goal is to educate developers on the [Plutus
Platform](./appendix/about-platform/plutus-platform.md). Which is a smart-contract
language for [Cardano](./appendix/about-platform/cardano.md) that is based on the
[Haskell](./appendix/haskell/haskell.md) programming language.

To understand and become proficient in Plutus, one has to understand the
following concepts:

- The **Haskell** programming language
- The **Extended UTXO model (EUTXO)**
- **Plutus Core** - the "on-chain" part of Plutus
- The **Plutus Application Framework (PAF)** - the "off-chain" part of Plutus
  that enables interaction with smart contracts.
- The **Plutus Application Binary (PAB)**

This is an education program for programmers. I am a part of the 3rd cohort: 10
weeks starting in January and ending March 2022.

## Resources
Enrolled students only: Course materials are available on [Instructure Canvas

Community Discord server :icon-link-external:](https://discord.gg/WmSVtQ5PjZ).

Post questions and document solutions on the [Cardano Stack Exchange
:icon-link-external:](https://cardano.stackexchange.com/). Questions about the
pioneer program are aggregated under the [plutus-pioneer-program tag
