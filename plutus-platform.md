# Plutus Platform

The Plutus platform provides a native smart contract language for the
[Cardano](./cardano.md) blockchain. It is built upon the
[Haskell](./haskell/haskell.md) programming language.

As of January 2022, the platform is still very new. Input Output HK (IOHK), also
known as Input Output Global (IOG) provide a "pioneer program" for the first
group of developers trying to learn how to use it. It's called the [Plutus
Pioneer Program](./plutus-pioneer-program.md).
