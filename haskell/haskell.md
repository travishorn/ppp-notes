# Haskell

Haskell is a [declarative](./imperative-vs-declarative.md), [statically
typed](./dynamic-vs-static-typing.md), [purely
functional](./impure-vs-pure-functions.md) programming language with type
inference and [lazy evaluation](./strict-vs-lazy-evaluation.md).

Smart contracts for the proof-of-stake blockchain platform
[Cardano](../about-platform/cardano.md) are written in Haskell.

Haskell uses very math-like concepts. It is basically an implementation of the
lambda calculus for computers.
