:icon-link-external:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X80uNXenWF4&list=PLNEK_Ejlx3x2nLM4fAck2JS6KhFQlXq2N&index=1)

Regular pre-recorded lectures on Thursdays and live Q&A session that will be
recorded on Tuesdays.

Collaboration is encouraged.

Will look at the EUTxO model which is different than the model Ethereum uses.
Requires a different way of thinking. Some things that are easy on other
blockchains may be hard to grasp on EUTxO model.

Will talk about tokens, on-chain and off-chain code, testing, state machines,
deployment.

This is the first cohort since smart contracts hit the Cardano blockchain.

Plutus learning is not easy. Will be a tough course. Everything is still new and
changing constantly. Tooling is elementary. Improvements probably weekly.
