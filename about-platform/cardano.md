# Cardano

Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform. Its smart contract language is
[Plutus](./plutus-platform.md), which is built upon the
[Haskell](../haskell/haskell.md) programming language.

The Cardano network is made up of distributed nodes that can be run by anyone.
Nodes are the core component that underpin the network. The blockchain network
is a collection of these interconnected nodes. Nodes process transactions on the
network.
